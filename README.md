# Excel_parser
A program for processing Excel files and drawing graphs

It's assumed, that Excel-file contains 3 columns:
  1. Label of transaction
  2. Elapse
  3. Timestamp (Jmeter format, milliseconds)

Default 1 - column 'C', 2 - column 'A', 3 - column 'B'

IMPORTANT. File must be sorted by timestamps (to avoid listener's mistakes)
